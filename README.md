# Official Website for Milan 2020

This is the **Official Website for Milan 2020**. Milan is a national level cultural fest organised by **Directorate of Student Affairs, SRM Institute of Science and Technology**.

The website is made by the following people:
* [Aniruddha Chatterjee](https://github.com/ruddha2001) *(Project Lead, Fullstack Developer)*
* [Gita Alekhya Paul](https://github.com/gitaalekhyapaul) *(Frontend Developer)*
* Snehil *(Frontend Developer and Graphics Editing)*

The website is based on **HTML/CSS** and uses **Javascript** to add functionality. **Bootstrap 4** finds its use in this website.

Basic **PHP** adds the backend functionality required for managing the cultural fest.

The project uses [Owl Carousel](https://github.com/OwlCarousel2/OwlCarousel2) as a dependency.

Some parts of the website are created using a HTML templating software [Mobirise](http://mobirise.com) due to lack of time the creators got for the project.
